Missing medication schedules is more common than we think, especially for those with busy routines or elderly family members. I want to design something easy to use—a simple device that gently reminds users to take their medication at the right time.
So I built HALF PILL a smart Wi-Fi enabled Pill Reminder using the [Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C3](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-ESP32C3-p-5431.html) and their beautiful [Round Display for XIAO](https://www.seeedstudio.com/1-28-Round-Touch-Display-for-Seeed-Studio-XIAO-ESP32.html). The device connects to your home Wi-Fi, syncs time using NTP servers, and allows pill schedules to be configured directly from a modern mobile web interface.
All pill schedules are configured through a mobile web interface that can be accessed from any phone connected to the same Wi-Fi network. The interface allows users to view existing schedules and add new medications easily, while the ESP32 stores the data securely in EEPROM.
The user can schedule up to 20 pills using this device
So let's go build one
